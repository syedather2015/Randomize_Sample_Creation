# Randomize_Sample_Creation
Randomize is an Excel VBA macro that helps you create a randomized, proportionate sample of rows from your dataset based on unique values in a user-selected column (called the RPG column). It colors selected rows and deletes the rest, providing an easy way to downsample large datasets while preserving representation across groups.
